# Task 1: Digit Classification (MNIST)

## Objective
The goal of this task is to develop and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** capable of classifying handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset**.  
This model serves as the **backbone** for subsequent object detection tasks.

## Network Architecture — `ModelBetterCNN`

The model is implemented as a **Sequential CNN**, designed to progressively extract visual features and perform digit classification.

### 1. Feature Extraction Block
- **Input:** 28×28 grayscale image  
- **Conv Layer 1:**  
  - 32 filters  
  - 3×3 kernel  
  - ReLU activation  
  - Captures low-level features such as edges
- **MaxPooling:**  
  - 2×2  
  - Reduces spatial dimensions
- **Conv Layer 2:**  
  - 64 filters  
  - 3×3 kernel  
  - ReLU activation  
  - Extracts more complex shapes and patterns
- **MaxPooling:**  
  - 2×2  
  - Further dimensionality reduction

### 2. Classification Head
- **Flatten Layer:** Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector  
- **Fully Connected Layer:**  
  - 128 neurons  
  - Interprets extracted features
- **Dropout:**  
  - 25%  
  - Reduces overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training
- **Output Layer:**  
  - 10 logits  
  - One for each digit class (0–9)

The model was evaluated on the **10,000-image MNIST test set**.  
Detailed per-class performance is shown below:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|--------:|
| 0 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 980 |
| 1 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 1135 |
| 2 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 1032 |
| 3 | 0.99 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 1010 |
| 4 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 982 |
| 5 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 892 |
| 6 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 958 |
| 7 | 0.98 | 0.99 | 0.99 | 1028 |
| 8 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 974 |
| 9 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 1009 |
| **AVG** | **0.99** | **0.99** | **0.99** | **10000** |

**Global Accuracy:** **99.X%** *(update with final value)*

## Visual Evaluation — Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix highlights the model’s strong classification performance.  
Most errors occur between digits with **similar geometries**, such as:
- 4 vs 9  
- 3 vs 8  

However, these misclassifications are **rare and minimal**, confirming the robustness of the trained CNN.
